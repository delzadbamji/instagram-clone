# instagram-clone

*Work-in-Progress*
This project was created to replicate the key features of Instagram. 

Hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it.

If you want to clone my project to add features, you may need to add your own env for firestore to work in your own implementation.

I shall soon deploy this implementation on a website and make it accessible for use. 

I used firestore to familiarize myself with the database better, but would love to port it out on MongoDB as a future expansion of this project.

Feel free to PR new features and help resolve issues(if any).
